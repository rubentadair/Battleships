# Simple Battleship Game

The Simple Battleship Game is a Java-based console game that brings the classic board game of Battleship to your IDE's console. Test your strategic skills as you engage in a thrilling battle against the computer opponent, trying to sink their ships before they sink yours!

## Gameplay

In this text-based version of Battleship, players take turns guessing the coordinates of their opponent's ships on a grid-based board. The objective is to accurately locate and destroy all of the opponent's ships before they find and sink yours.

The game follows these rules:
- Each player has a 10x10 grid to place their ships.
- Ships are represented by consecutive cells on the grid, either horizontally or vertically.
- Players take turns guessing the coordinates of their opponent's ships.
- The game provides feedback on each guess, indicating whether it was a hit, miss, or if a ship was sunk.
- The first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins the game.

## Features
